SplitMAC architecture is a design approach used in modern wireless networks where the traditional functions of a wireless Access Point (AP) are divided between the AP itself and a centralized controller, often called a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). In a conventional AP, both the real-time MAC functions (like frame acknowledgments, retransmissions, encryption, etc.) and higher-layer MAC functions (such as association management, authentication and roaming decisions) are handled entirely within the AP. However, in SplitMAC architecture, the time-critical MAC operations (like encryption, decryption, acknowledgments) are kept locally on the AP to maintain fast performance, while the management and control functions (like client authentication, mobility management, load balancing and policy enforcement) are offloaded to the controller. This split improves the APâ€™s performance by reducing processing burden, allowing the AP to focus mainly on efficient frame delivery and radio management, leading to faster and more reliable wireless communication. Additionally, centralized management through the controller enables better network scalability, simplified configuration and updates, improved security policy enforcement and easier mobility support as clients roam between APs.
