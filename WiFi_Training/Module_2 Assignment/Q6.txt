Sniffer mode and Monitor mode both involve capturing wireless traffic, but they are used differently depending on the device and situation.

In Monitor mode, a wireless device (like a laptopâ€™s Wi-Fi adapter) is put into a special listening state where it can capture all wireless frames it hears, across different networks, without needing to connect to any access point. It captures management frames, control frames and data frames passively, allowing deep analysis of wireless activity. Monitor mode is commonly used in wireless security audits, penetration testing (like capturing WPA handshakes), spectrum analysis and detecting rogue access points. It is mainly used on laptops or dedicated wireless tools.

On the other hand, Sniffer mode typically refers to when an Access Point (AP) is instructed to capture wireless traffic on a specific channel and forward the raw captured packets to a centralized analyzer tool like Wireshark. In sniffer mode, the AP does not serve clients but acts like a dedicated sensor. Sniffer mode is used mainly for troubleshooting client connectivity, analyzing real-time wireless performance, examining roaming behavior and identifying packet-level issues in enterprise networks.
