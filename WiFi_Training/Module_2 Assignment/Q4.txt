1) Lightweight APs:

Lightweight Access Points depend on an on-premises Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) to function.
The AP handles basic functions like sending/receiving wireless signals, while the WLC centrally manages authentication, security policies, RF management, roaming decisions and configurations.
Communication between the AP and controller typically uses the CAPWAP protocol.
If the connection to the controller fails, many lightweight APs either go into a limited failover mode or stop servicing clients completely.
Deployment Scope: Ideal for enterprise environments where the WLC can be physically close to the APs or within the same corporate network.


2) Cloud-based APs:

Cloud-based APs are designed to be managed directly from a cloud controller platform (hosted by the vendor like Cisco Meraki, Aruba Central, Ruckus Cloud, etc.)
No physical on-site controller is needed; the cloud acts as the controller.
APs connect securely over the Internet to the cloud for management, configuration, firmware updates, monitoring and analytics.
Even if the Internet link fails, most cloud-managed APs continue to serve clients (at least for local traffic) and synchronize with the cloud once the connection is restored.
Deployment Scope: Ideal for distributed sites, branch offices, or businesses without a strong IT presence on-site because it provides easy remote management.
