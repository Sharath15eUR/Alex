--> In Local Mode, the AP does not handle client traffic by itself. Instead, it forwards all client data frames and management frames (like authentication, association, etc.) to the WLC through a CAPWAP tunnel.

--> If the WLC goes down, the AP loses its CAPWAP control and data tunnels.

--> When the tunnels are lost, the AP is unable to authenticate new clients, unable to forward existing client traffic, and cannot manage session maintenance.

--> As a result, the client will get disconnected from the wireless network within seconds.

--> The AP itself may enter a "Discovery" or "Fallback" state, trying to find another WLC (if redundancy is configured).
