Hereâ€™s how it works step-by-step:

1. Tunnel Establishment:
When an AP boots up, it discovers the controller using methods like DHCP Option 43, DNS, or broadcasting.
The AP initiates a CAPWAP Control Channel and Data Channel setup.
A DTLS handshake (if security is enabled) is performed to create a secure control tunnel.

2. Keepalive Messages:
After the tunnels are established, the AP and controller periodically exchange keepalive (heartbeat) messages over the control tunnel.
This ensures that both the AP and controller know the connection is still active.
If no keepalive is received within a certain time window (e.g., 30 seconds, depending on configuration), the tunnel is considered lost and the AP may reboot or attempt to rejoin.

3. Session Timeouts and Retries:
CAPWAP includes built-in timers to monitor the connection.
If control messages or keepalives are missed for a configured number of retries, the AP will restart the discovery and join process to find a controller again.

4. DTLS Session Maintenance:
If encryption is enabled, the DTLS session must be kept alive.
Re-negotiation can happen after long periods to maintain encryption security.
Session keys may be refreshed based on policy.

5. Error Handling and Failover:
If the AP detects that the controller is unreachable, it can failover to a secondary backup controller if one is configured.
Otherwise, the AP resets and tries to rediscover a controller to re-establish CAPWAP tunnels.

6. Dynamic Updates:
Even after establishment, any dynamic changes like VLAN assignment, policy updates, or radio configuration changes are pushed through the control tunnel without requiring a new tunnel setup.
