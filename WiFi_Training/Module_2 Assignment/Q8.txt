1. Configuration and Management Complexity
Each AP must be configured manually one by one (SSID settings, security policies, VLANs, etc.).
Any change (like updating passwords or enabling a new SSID) must be manually done on every AP, making network administration extremely time-consuming and error-prone.
Keeping all APs consistent in their configuration is very difficult.

2. Scalability Issues
As the number of APs increases, it becomes harder to scale the network efficiently.
Autonomous APs do not coordinate with each other automatically (no centralized intelligence), so optimizing channel planning, roaming and load balancing becomes almost impossible manually in a large deployment.

3. Lack of Centralized Control and Monitoring
Without a controller, there is no single dashboard to monitor AP status, client health, RF interference, or troubleshoot problems.
Detecting network problems (like rogue APs, high channel utilization, or dead zones) becomes manual and very slow.
