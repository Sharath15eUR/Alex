CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is a standardized protocol defined in RFC 5415 that enables communication between wireless Access Points (APs) and a centralized Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). The main goal of CAPWAP is to separate the control plane and the data plane, allowing centralized management of APs while still maintaining efficient data transmission. Through CAPWAP, the controller can configure, manage and monitor multiple APs without requiring manual intervention at each AP. CAPWAP also provides secure communication using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) to protect control messages between the AP and the controller.
