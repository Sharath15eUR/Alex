In the PHY layer of wireless communication, PPDU, PLCP and PMD are three important components that together handle the transmission and reception of frames over the air. PPDU (Physical Protocol Data Unit) is the complete data unit that is prepared by the PHY layer for transmission. It includes the PHY preamble, PHY header and the MAC frame payload. The PPDU is what is actually transmitted over the wireless medium. Within the PHY layer, the PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol) is responsible for taking the MAC layer frame, adding necessary PHY headers and preambles and preparing it to be sent as a PPDU. PLCP helps in providing the necessary timing and synchronization information to the receiving device, allowing it to properly decode the incoming frame. Below the PLCP is the PMD (Physical Medium Dependent) sublayer, which deals with the actual transmission and reception of bits over the physical medium, such as modulating the signal onto the carrier frequency and converting received signals back into bits. In simple terms, PLCP packages the data properly and provides necessary signaling, while PMD actually pushes the data through the air or receives it from the air and PPDU is the full packet that travels between sender and receiver. Together, these components ensure reliable wireless communication by bridging the MAC layer data with the physical radio transmission.
