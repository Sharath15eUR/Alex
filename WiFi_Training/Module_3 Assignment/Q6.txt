In WLAN transmission, a Guard Interval (GI) is a short time period inserted between transmitted symbols to prevent interference caused by delayed signals, known as inter-symbol interference (ISI), which results from multipath reflections in wireless environments. Essentially, the Guard Interval acts like a "buffer zone" that allows the receiver to correctly distinguish between consecutive symbols even when some echoes of previous symbols are still arriving. Traditionally, Wi-Fi systems used a long Guard Interval of 800 nanoseconds to handle multipath effects in most environments. However, with the improvement in wireless technologies and environments with less severe multipath issues, a short Guard Interval of 400 nanoseconds was introduced, especially in standards like 802.11n, 802.11ac and 802.11ax. A short Guard Interval improves efficiency by reducing the overhead time between symbols, allowing more symbols to be transmitted in a given time frame. This directly increases the data throughput by about 10%, making the communication faster without requiring more bandwidth. However, short GI can be less effective in very noisy or highly reflective environments, where longer intervals might still be necessary to maintain reliable communication. Thus, using a short Guard Interval is a trade-off between maximizing throughput and ensuring stable performance based on environmental conditions.
