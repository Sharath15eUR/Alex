MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) and MU-MIMO (Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output) are both wireless technologies that use multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance, but they serve different purposes. MIMO was first introduced to increase the data rate and reliability for a single device by transmitting multiple data streams simultaneously across multiple antennas. This technique improves throughput and resilience against signal fading without needing extra bandwidth or power. However, MIMO communicates with only one device at a time, even if multiple antennas are available. On the other hand, MU-MIMO is an advanced form of MIMO that allows an access point (AP) to communicate with multiple devices simultaneously, each device receiving its own data stream over the same frequency at the same time. MU-MIMO significantly improves network efficiency and user experience, especially in environments with many connected devices, like offices or stadiums. MIMO was widely used in 802.11n and 802.11ac, while MU-MIMO was introduced with 802.11ac Wave 2 and improved further in 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6). In short, MIMO boosts individual device performance, while MU-MIMO boosts overall network capacity by serving multiple users at once.
