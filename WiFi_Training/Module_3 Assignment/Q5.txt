Wi-Fi operates over multiple frequency bands that are divided to support different speeds, ranges and capacities, allowing devices to communicate wirelessly without excessive interference. The most commonly used frequency bands for Wi-Fi are the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands, each with their own set of channels. The 2.4 GHz band ranges from 2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz and offers 14 channels (depending on the country), but only three — channels 1, 6 and 11 — are non-overlapping, meaning they can be used simultaneously without causing interference. This band has better range and wall penetration but is more prone to congestion because it is shared with many other devices like Bluetooth, microwave ovens and cordless phones. The 5 GHz band ranges from 5.150 GHz to 5.825 GHz and provides many more non-overlapping channels, offering less interference, higher speeds and lower range compared to 2.4 GHz. It supports wider channel bandwidths like 40 MHz, 80 MHz and even 160 MHz (for very high throughput), enabling faster data transfer for applications like HD streaming and gaming. The newest 6 GHz band, introduced with Wi-Fi 6E, spans from 5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz, offering up to 59 new 20 MHz channels depending on the region. This band is designed to alleviate congestion, providing massive capacity, ultra-low latency and supporting high-speed connections for next-generation applications. Overall, these divisions into bands and channels allow Wi-Fi networks to be more flexible, efficient and better suited to different environments and usage requirements.
