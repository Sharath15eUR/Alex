Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) plays a critical role in improving the performance of WLAN (Wireless Local Area Networks) by enhancing data transmission efficiency, robustness and speed. The main significance of OFDM lies in its ability to divide a wide frequency channel into multiple closely spaced, orthogonal subcarriers, with each subcarrier carrying a part of the overall data. This division makes OFDM highly resistant to multipath fading and interference, common issues in wireless environments where signals can reflect off walls and objects. By transmitting data in parallel streams across these subcarriers, OFDM ensures higher spectral efficiency and reduces the impact of signal distortion. Moreover, since each subcarrier operates at a lower data rate, it minimizes inter-symbol interference (ISI), allowing for more reliable communication even in challenging conditions. Introduced in 802.11a and later used in 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac and 802.11ax standards, OFDM significantly increases WLAN throughput and range, enabling support for high-speed internet, video streaming and other bandwidth-intensive applications while maintaining better stability and performance in real-world deployments.
