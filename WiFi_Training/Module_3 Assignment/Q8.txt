OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) are both based on the same fundamental technology of splitting a wide channel into multiple closely spaced, orthogonal subcarriers, but they serve different purposes. OFDM is used to transmit data from a single user by sending parts of their data stream in parallel across all subcarriers. It improves speed and robustness against multipath fading but still only serves one user at a time on the whole channel. In contrast, OFDMA is an extension of OFDM that allows multiple users to be served simultaneously by assigning different groups of subcarriers to different users within the same channel. This makes OFDMA much more efficient, especially in high-density environments, as it reduces latency, improves spectrum utilization and supports better uplink and downlink performance. OFDM was used in earlier Wi-Fi standards like 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac, while OFDMA was introduced in 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) to dramatically enhance network efficiency, particularly when many devices are connected at once. In short, while OFDM improves data transmission for a single user, OFDMA optimizes how the channel is shared among multiple users simultaneously.
