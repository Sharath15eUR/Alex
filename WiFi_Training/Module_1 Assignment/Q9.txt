There are several types of Wi-Fi internet connectivity backhaul:
1. Wired
2. Wireless
3. Hybrid

* Wired backhaul uses physical media like Ethernet cables, fiber-optic links or even coaxial cables, offering high reliability and bandwidth. 

* Wireless backhaul, employs radio frequency links—such as 5 GHz point-to-point bridges, microwave links or even cellular connections making it ideal when laying cables is impractical. 

* A hybrid approach combines both wired and wireless elements to extend network coverage and improve flexibility.

At my home, we use a hybrid setup where the primary backhaul is a fiber-optic connection provided by our ISP, ensuring high-speed and low-latency internet. To extend coverage into the backyard and other remote areas, we’ve added a wireless backhaul using a dedicated 5 GHz access point configured in bridge mode.
