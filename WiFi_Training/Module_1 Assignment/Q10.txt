Different Wi-Fi Topologies are as follows:
 
1. Infrastructure Mode:
Client devices connect to a central access point (AP) which in turn connects to a wired network. This is the most common topology used in homes, offices and public hotspots.

2. Ad-Hoc Mode (Peer-to-Peer):
Devices communicate directly with one another without an AP. This setup is useful for temporary networks, small group file sharing or gaming scenarios where a quick, direct connection is needed.

3. Mesh Networking:
Multiple nodes connect in a decentralized manner to cover a wide area. Mesh networks are ideal for large campuses, community networks or smart home systems where seamless roaming and robust coverage are required.
