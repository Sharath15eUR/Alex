* IEEE is a standards development organization responsible for creating and maintaining the technical specifications that underlie technologies such as Wi-Fi (802.11 family)

* Whereas the Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) is an industry consortium that tests and certifies products for compliance with these standards, ensuring interoperability and a consistent user experience across different vendors. 

Essentially, while IEEE lays down the rules and technical details, the WFA acts as the gatekeeper, verifying that devices meet those guidelines and can work together seamlessly in a network.
