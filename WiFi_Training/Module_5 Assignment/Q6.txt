Wi-Fi 7, or 802.11be, introduces several major innovations to further enhance wireless network performance, building on the advancements made by Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E. One of the most significant innovations is the introduction of 320 MHz channels, which doubles the channel bandwidth compared to Wi-Fi 6's 160 MHz, allowing for much higher data ratesâ€”up to 46 Gbps in ideal conditions. This increase in bandwidth improves overall throughput and supports high-demand applications like 8K video streaming, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Another key feature of Wi-Fi 7 is the enhanced version of OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), which supports multi-channel operation across wider channels, allowing more devices to operate simultaneously with reduced latency and increased efficiency. Wi-Fi 7 also introduces 4096-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), which increases the data transmission rate by encoding more data into each symbol, offering better spectral efficiency and higher speeds. Additionally, MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple Input, Multiple Output) is further enhanced to support more simultaneous connections, improving network capacity in dense environments. Target Wake Time (TWT), which optimizes power consumption for IoT devices, is also part of Wi-Fi 7, allowing devices to communicate with access points in a more energy-efficient manner. Finally, Wi-Fi 7 enhances the use of Multi-Link Operation (MLO), which allows devices to send and receive data simultaneously across multiple frequency bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 6 GHz), improving reliability and reducing congestion. Overall, Wi-Fi 7 delivers higher speeds, better efficiency, lower latency and improved reliability, making it ideal for future-proofing networks to handle increasing demands for data and the growing number of connected devices.
