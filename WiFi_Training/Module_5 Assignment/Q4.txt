The 6 GHz band adds 1,200 MHz of additional spectrum (from 5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz) to Wi-Fi networks, which is more than the combined bandwidth available in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands used by previous Wi-Fi generations. This expanded spectrum allows for wider channels (up to 160 MHz), enabling much faster data transmission rates and providing better performance for high-bandwidth applications like 4K/8K streaming, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and large file transfers.
