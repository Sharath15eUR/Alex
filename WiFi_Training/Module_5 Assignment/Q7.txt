Multi-Link Operation (MLO) is a key feature introduced in Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) that allows a device to simultaneously use multiple frequency bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 6 GHz) for data transmission. Unlike previous Wi-Fi generations, where devices were restricted to using a single channel in one frequency band at a time, MLO enables simultaneous communication across multiple links, thereby increasing overall throughput and improving reliability. By leveraging multiple links, MLO can effectively aggregate bandwidth from different bands, leading to higher data rates. For example, a device can transmit and receive data on both the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands concurrently, which significantly boosts throughput compared to operating on a single band.

The impact on throughput is substantial, as MLO allows for parallel transmission, making it possible to achieve much faster speeds and handle larger data loads. This capability is particularly beneficial in high-demand scenarios, such as high-definition video streaming, online gaming and virtual reality, where low latency and high throughput are critical.

In terms of latency, MLO improves performance by enabling simultaneous transmissions over different bands, reducing congestion on any single channel. By spreading the communication load across multiple links, MLO minimizes the chances of network bottlenecks or interference, leading to lower latency and a more stable, responsive connection. Additionally, MLO enhances the network's resilience to interference and signal degradation because if one frequency band experiences congestion or interference, the device can seamlessly switch to another band, ensuring consistent performance. Overall, MLO significantly enhances both throughput and latency, offering a more efficient and reliable wireless experience, especially in environments with a high density of connected devices.
