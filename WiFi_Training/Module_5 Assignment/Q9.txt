Fast BSS Transition (802.11r) is a feature designed to improve the roaming performance of wireless devices in mobile environments, such as when users move between access points (APs) within a network. The primary goal of 802.11r is to reduce the time it takes for a client device to switch from one AP to another while maintaining an uninterrupted connection. Typically, when a device roams between APs in a traditional Wi-Fi network, it has to go through a time-consuming process of re-authentication and association with the new AP, leading to noticeable delays or even dropped connections. 802.11r addresses this by enabling fast handoff through a process known as pre-authentication. This process allows a client device to perform authentication with a target AP before actually switching over, reducing the time needed for the handoff.

The benefit of 802.11r in mobile environments, particularly for applications like VoIP (Voice over IP), video conferencing and real-time communication, is immense. It allows for seamless connectivity as devices move through large areas with multiple APs, such as in airports, stadiums, or enterprise campuses. By reducing roaming latency and preventing dropped connections, 802.11r ensures a smooth user experience in environments with high mobility, making it a crucial technology for any modern Wi-Fi network designed to support mobile users and real-time applications.
