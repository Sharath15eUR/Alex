Wi-Fi 6 builds on Wi-Fi 5 but is designed for high-density environments like stadiums, offices and smart homes. It introduces OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) to allow multiple devices to share the same channel efficiently, MU-MIMO for both uplink and downlink (Wi-Fi 5 had only downlink MU-MIMO), BSS Coloring to reduce interference between neighboring networks, Target Wake Time (TWT) for better battery efficiency in IoT devices and supports 1024-QAM for higher throughput. Wi-Fi 6 operates in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands and improves overall user experience even when many devices are connected.

Wi-Fi 6E is an extension of Wi-Fi 6, but it operates in the newly opened 6 GHz band (in addition to 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz). This provides much more spectrum, resulting in wider channels (up to 160 MHz) with less interference, leading to better speed and reliability, especially for applications like AR/VR, HD video streaming and low-latency gaming.

Wi-Fi 7 takes things much further by introducing 320 MHz channel bandwidth (double Wi-Fi 6/6E), 4096-QAM modulation for even higher data rates and Multi-Link Operation (MLO), allowing devices to use multiple bands or channels simultaneously for faster, more reliable connections. It also supports enhanced MU-MIMO and OFDMA improvements, which greatly boost speed, reduce latency and enhance stability, even in extremely crowded networks. Wi-Fi 7 is designed to power applications like 8K streaming, VR/AR, cloud gaming and ultra-low latency industrial use cases.
