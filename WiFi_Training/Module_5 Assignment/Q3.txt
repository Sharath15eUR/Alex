* Improved Power Efficiency: One of the main advantages of TWT is that it allows IoT devices to conserve power. With TWT, the access point and the device can negotiate and schedule specific times for the device to wake up and communicate. This eliminates the need for devices to stay awake and listen for transmissions from the AP, which is particularly important for battery-powered IoT devices. By waking up only at scheduled times, devices can significantly extend their battery life.

* Reduced Contention and Interference: Traditional Wi-Fi communications often rely on devices competing for the same transmission time, which can lead to congestion and interference, particularly in dense environments. TWT allows devices to schedule their wake-up times so that multiple devices are not competing for the same airtime. This results in more efficient use of the wireless spectrum, reduces interference and enhances the overall performance of the network.

* Increased Network Efficiency: With TWT, the access point can schedule communications for multiple IoT devices in a way that minimizes collisions and optimizes the use of available bandwidth. This scheduling ensures that the network is not overwhelmed by simultaneous requests from devices, improving overall throughput and reducing latency. TWT helps provide a more stable and predictable network performance, which is crucial for time-sensitive IoT applications such as smart homes, health monitoring and industrial automation.

* Better Scalability for IoT Networks: TWT enables better scalability of IoT networks by efficiently managing a large number of devices. As the number of connected devices increases, it can be challenging to maintain good performance. With TWT, the AP can manage the traffic from hundreds or thousands of IoT devices by assigning specific wake times to each, ensuring that the network can handle a larger number of devices without congestion or significant degradation in performance.
