WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is considered insecure compared to WPA2 and WPA3 due to several fundamental weaknesses in its design. First, WEP uses the RC4 stream cipher with short key lengths (40-bit or 104-bit), which makes it vulnerable to brute force attacks and key cracking. The encryption keys in WEP are static, meaning the same key is reused for every transmission, which significantly increases the risk of key reuse attacks. Furthermore, the initialization vector (IV) used in WEP encryption is only 24 bits long, which leads to IV repetition in a busy network, allowing attackers to capture and analyze packets more easily. This repetition of IVs can result in patterns being identified, which can then be exploited to recover the encryption key.

In addition to the weak encryption, WEPâ€™s key management system is also flawed. It does not offer dynamic key exchange or proper authentication mechanisms, allowing attackers to intercept or guess the encryption key more quickly. This lack of robust key management makes it easier for attackers to gain access to the network.
