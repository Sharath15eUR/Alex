* WEP, the oldest of the four, was introduced in 1997 as a part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard. It uses the RC4 stream cipher for encryption, but its security is weak due to short encryption keys (40-bit or 104-bit) and flaws in the key management process. This makes WEP easily susceptible to cracking attacks and it is now considered obsolete and insecure for modern Wi-Fi networks.

* WPA was introduced in 2003 as a temporary replacement for WEP, primarily designed to address the vulnerabilities in WEP. It still uses the RC4 cipher, but it replaces WEPâ€™s weak key management with a more robust method called TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol). While WPA improved security over WEP, it still has weaknesses and was eventually replaced by WPA2 as it is also vulnerable to modern attack methods, such as dictionary attacks.

* WPA2, introduced in 2004, is the most widely used Wi-Fi security protocol and significantly strengthens security compared to WPA. It uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption, which is much more secure than RC4. WPA2 is designed to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks and it introduced a stronger form of authentication through 802.1X and EAP. While WPA2 is still secure, it has some vulnerabilities, especially with weak passwords and poor implementation.

* WPA3, introduced in 2018, is the latest and most secure Wi-Fi protocol. It enhances WPA2 by providing stronger encryption with AES-256 and improving user authentication through Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which is resistant to offline dictionary attacks. WPA3 also provides stronger security for open networks by introducing OWE (Opportunistic Wireless Encryption) and improves privacy protection through features like forward secrecy, ensuring that data from previous sessions cannot be decrypted if the network key is compromised later. WPA3 also introduces Enhanced Open and Easy Connect to simplify secure connection for IoT devices and new users.
