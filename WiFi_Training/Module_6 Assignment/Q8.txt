If a wrong passphrase is provided during the 4-way handshake, the process will fail to complete successfully. The 4-way handshake relies on the exchange of cryptographic keys derived from the shared Pairwise Master Key (PMK), which is generated based on the passphrase (or pre-shared key) in WPA2 (or WPA3). When the client enters an incorrect passphrase, the PMK derived from it will not match the correct PMK stored on the Access Point (AP).

As a result, during the handshake, the client and the AP will derive different Pairwise Transient Keys (PTK). This mismatch in keys means that the encrypted messages exchanged between the client and the AP will not be able to be properly decrypted on either side. Consequently, the 4-way handshake will fail and the AP will reject the clientâ€™s connection attempt. The client will not be able to establish a secure communication channel with the AP and access to the network will be denied. This security mechanism ensures that only clients with the correct passphrase can successfully complete the handshake, preventing unauthorized access to the network.
