Authentication and encryption are two fundamental aspects of Wi-Fi security, but they serve different purposes in protecting the network and the data transmitted over it.

Authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a device or user attempting to connect to the Wi-Fi network. It ensures that only authorized entities are allowed to join the network, preventing unauthorized access. In Wi-Fi security, authentication typically involves checking credentials, such as passwords, certificates, or other authentication protocols like EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol). This ensures that only legitimate users or devices can access the network and its resources, preventing malicious actors from gaining entry.

On the other hand, encryption is the process of protecting the data transmitted over the network by converting it into an unreadable format. Even if an attacker intercepts the data, they would not be able to make sense of it without the proper decryption key. Encryption ensures the confidentiality of the data, safeguarding it from eavesdropping or unauthorized access while it is in transit. In Wi-Fi security, encryption methods like WPA2 and WPA3 use protocols like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to protect the data.
