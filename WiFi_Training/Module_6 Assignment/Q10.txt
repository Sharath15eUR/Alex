802.1X significantly enhances security over wireless networks by implementing a strong authentication mechanism that ensures only authorized devices and users can access the network. Unlike older protocols such as WEP or WPA, which rely on shared secrets like a static passphrase, 802.1X uses a centralized authentication server (typically a RADIUS server) to authenticate each device attempting to connect. This means that each connection request is individually verified and access is granted based on the device's credentials, such as usernames, passwords, certificates, or other forms of authentication.

This dynamic, per-session authentication process helps mitigate risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks and rogue devices gaining access to the network. 802.1X also supports stronger encryption and key management through protocols like WPA2 and WPA3, where unique encryption keys are derived for each session, making it harder for attackers to crack the encryption even if they intercept traffic. Additionally, the protocol can be configured to enforce more stringent security policies, such as certificate-based authentication, which further strengthens security by ensuring that only devices with valid credentials can join the network.

In wireless environments, where security threats such as eavesdropping and interception are more prevalent, 802.1X provides an essential layer of protection by ensuring that unauthorized users cannot easily gain access, thus greatly improving the overall security posture of the network.
