WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) was introduced in 2004 as a response to the security vulnerabilities of its predecessor, WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and the even weaker WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). The primary goal of WPA2 was to provide a more robust and secure method for encrypting wireless communication, addressing the significant flaws in WEP and the temporary improvements offered by WPA. WPA2 introduced AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) as the mandatory encryption algorithm, replacing the insecure RC4 cipher used in WEP and WPA. AES provided much stronger encryption, significantly improving the confidentiality of data transmitted over Wi-Fi networks.

Additionally, WPA2 incorporated improvements in key management and authentication, offering better protection against man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks. It used 802.1X for enterprise networks, enabling stronger user authentication methods, such as EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol), which could incorporate certificates, smart cards and other secure credentials. By doing so, WPA2 greatly enhanced the security of Wi-Fi networks, making it the standard for Wi-Fi security for many years. WPA2 was necessary because, at the time of its introduction, WEP was easily cracked and WPA, though an improvement, still used weak encryption and did not provide enough protection against modern security threats.
