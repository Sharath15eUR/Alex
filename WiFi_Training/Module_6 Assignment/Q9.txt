802.1X solves the problem of network access control and authentication by providing a robust method for authenticating devices that attempt to connect to a network, particularly in enterprise environments. Prior to 802.1X, network access was often based on shared secrets (such as WEP or WPA passphrases) that could be easily compromised, making it difficult to ensure that only authorized users and devices could access the network. 802.1X addresses this by implementing a port-based access control mechanism, where a device must first authenticate itself before gaining access to the network.

In an 802.1X-enabled network, when a device attempts to connect, it is initially placed in a "restricted" state. It cannot communicate with the rest of the network until it successfully authenticates via the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). The authentication process typically involves a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server that verifies the identity of the device (or user) by checking credentials such as usernames, passwords, certificates, or even biometric data. Only after successful authentication is the device granted access to the network.

This solution improves network security by ensuring that only authenticated users or devices can access network resources, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access. It also allows for more granular control over who and what can connect to the network, which is particularly valuable in environments where sensitive data is transmitted. Additionally, it supports dynamic key management, enhancing encryption and further securing wireless communications in protocols like WPA2 and WPA3. Overall, 802.1X provides a scalable, flexible and secure method for managing network access in diverse environments.
