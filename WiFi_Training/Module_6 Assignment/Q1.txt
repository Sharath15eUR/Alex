The pillars of Wi-Fi security are Confidentiality, Authentication, and Integrity. These elements work together to ensure the protection of data and the security of the wireless network.

1. Confidentiality:
Confidentiality ensures that the data transmitted over the Wi-Fi network remains private and is protected from unauthorized access. This is achieved through encryption, which converts the transmitted data into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted by authorized parties with the correct decryption key. In Wi-Fi networks, protocols like WPA2 and WPA3 use encryption methods such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to ensure that even if an attacker intercepts the data being transmitted, they cannot read or manipulate it. Confidentiality is essential to protect sensitive information, such as personal data, financial transactions, and confidential communications, from eavesdropping or unauthorized access.

2. Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of devices or users attempting to connect to the Wi-Fi network. It ensures that only authorized users or devices are granted access to the network, preventing unauthorized access or attacks. WPA2 and WPA3 use various authentication methods, including EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) for enterprise networks, which may involve certificates, passwords, or multi-factor authentication to confirm the identity of the user or device. WPA3 introduces SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals), which enhances security for personal networks by making it more resistant to offline dictionary attacks. Authentication helps in safeguarding the network from rogue devices or malicious actors trying to gain unauthorized access.

3. Integrity:
Integrity ensures that the data transmitted over the Wi-Fi network remains unchanged and is not altered or tampered with during transmission. This is achieved by using message integrity checks (MIC), which create a hash of the data being transmitted. The hash is checked at both ends of the communication to ensure that the data has not been modified in transit. WPA2 and WPA3 use mechanisms like CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol) to ensure data integrity. If any alteration is detected, the data is discarded, and the transmission is considered invalid. Integrity is crucial to prevent malicious attackers from tampering with data, such as altering communication between devices, injecting malicious content, or causing disruptions to the network.
