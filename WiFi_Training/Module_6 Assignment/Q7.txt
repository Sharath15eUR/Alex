The 4-way handshake plays a crucial role in ensuring mutual authentication between the client and the Access Point (AP) in Wi-Fi networks, particularly in WPA2 and WPA3. This handshake process, which occurs after the client attempts to connect to the network, involves a series of messages exchanged between the client and the AP. The mutual authentication is achieved through the use of shared secrets and the verification of key material derived from these secrets.

The handshake begins with the AP sending a nonce (a random number) to the client and the client responding by generating its own nonce. These nonces, along with the shared Pairwise Master Key (PMK), are used to derive the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which is used for encrypting communication. The AP and the client then use this PTK to encrypt the subsequent messages in the handshake process. The fourth and final message of the handshake verifies that both the client and the AP have correctly derived the same keys. This ensures that neither party is an imposter and that the encryption keys being used are valid and synchronized.

Additionally, during this exchange, the AP verifies the client’s credentials through the exchange of cryptographic material and the client verifies that it is communicating with the correct AP by confirming the AP’s identity. If either side fails to validate the other, the handshake process is aborted, preventing unauthorized access to the network. Thus, the 4-way handshake guarantees that both the client and the AP are mutually authenticated, ensuring that both parties can trust the communication and that encryption is correctly established for secure data transmission.
