* How Block ACK Works:

1. The sender and receiver first agree to use Block ACK through an initial setup (Block ACK Request/Response).
2. The sender transmits a burst of data frames (called an A-MPDU â€“ Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit).
3. Instead of sending an ACK after each frame, the receiver sends a Block ACK frame that includes a bitmap indicating which frames were successfully received and which were not.
4. The sender can then retransmit only the missing frames, improving efficiency.

* Advantages of Block ACK:

-> Improved Throughput
-> Lower Latency
-> Better Channel Utilization
-> Reduced Control Overhead
