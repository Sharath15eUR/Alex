In IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), the MAC layer uses contention-based and contention-free methods to manage access to the medium.

Main MAC Methodologies:

1. Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) – Contention-Based
2. Point Coordination Function (PCF) – Contention-Free
3. Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) – Used in QoS (802.11e)
4. OFDMA-Based Access (Wi-Fi 6 / 802.11ax)
