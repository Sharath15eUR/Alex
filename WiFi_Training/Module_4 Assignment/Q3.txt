1. Management Plane Functions
These functions are responsible for establishing, maintaining and terminating connections between devices.

* Beacon generation: APs periodically send beacons to announce their presence and provide network information (SSID, supported rates, etc.).
* Authentication: Initial process where devices verify each other before joining a network.
* Association/Reassociation: Helps devices join a network (association) or move to a different AP within the same network (reassociation).
* Deauthentication/Disassociation: Ends the authenticated or associated state of a station.
* Probe Request/Response: Stations send probe requests to find available networks; APs reply with probe responses.
* Timing synchronization: Devices synchronize their clocks using beacon frames.
* Capability negotiation: Devices exchange capabilities such as supported data rates, encryption types, etc.
* Security management: Includes the handling of encryption keys and security policy enforcement.
* Power management coordination: Allows stations to enter sleep modes and buffer traffic during that time.


2. Control Plane Functions
Control frames support the delivery and coordination of data and management frames.

* RTS (Request to Send)/CTS (Clear to Send): Used to avoid collisions in environments with hidden nodes.
* ACK (Acknowledgement): Confirms the successful receipt of frames.
* PS-Poll (Power Save Poll): Allows stations in power-saving mode to request buffered data from the AP.
* Block ACK and Block ACK Request: Used to acknowledge multiple frames in a burst transmission (e.g., in high-throughput networks).
* Contention window management: Manages how devices wait before accessing the channel to avoid collisions.


3. Data Plane Functions
These functions are responsible for transferring actual user data between devices.

* Frame encapsulation/decapsulation: Adds/removes MAC headers to/from data coming from upper layers.
* MAC addressing: Uses source and destination MAC addresses to identify devices.
* Fragmentation and reassembly: Splits large frames into smaller ones and reassembles them at the receiver.
* Error detection: Uses Frame Check Sequence (FCS) to detect errors in frames.
* Data transmission and retransmission: Handles sending data and retrying when acknowledgements are not received.
* Traffic prioritization (QoS): Supports prioritization of data streams (e.g., voice over video) using Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA).
* Aggregation (A-MSDU/A-MPDU): Combines multiple frames for efficient transmission in modern Wi-Fi versions.
