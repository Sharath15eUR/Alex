Q. How NAT (Network Address Translation) Handles Private IPs while accessing the internet?

When a device with a private IP address needs to access the internet, it must pass through a router that uses NAT.

1. The private IP device sends a request to access a public website (eg. google.com)
2. The router replaces the private IP address with its public IP address (assigned by the ISP)
3. The request reaches the destination (google's server)
4. The server replies to the router’s public IP
5. The router then translates it back to the correct private IP and forwards it to the originating device
