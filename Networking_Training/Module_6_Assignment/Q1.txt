Q. Why is ARP Important in Packet Forwarding?

When a device wants to send a packet to another device or to a router it ;
1. Knows the IP address, but not the MAC address
2. Uses ARP to find the MAC address corresponding to that IP address
3. Then forwards the packet using the destination MAC address

Without ARP, devices wouldn't be able to communicate within a LAN or send packets to a router.
