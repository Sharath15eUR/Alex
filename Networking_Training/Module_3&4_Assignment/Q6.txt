1. First, we need to activate the network interface. Suppose the interface is named eth0,

ip link set dev eth0 up

This command tells the kernel to enable eth0 for traffic

2. We need to assign an IP address and subnet mask to the interface. For example, to configure the interface with IP address 192.168.1.10 on a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask,

ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0

This sets up the basic addressing for the LAN

3. we need to add a default route pointing to our gateway. If our gatewayâ€™s IP is 192.168.1.1, we can configure it as follows:

ip route add default via 192.168.1.1

This tells the kernel that packets destined for addresses outside the local network should be sent to 192.168.1.1

4. we can verify that the interface is up and configured correctly using:

ip addr show dev eth0
