* In Linux-based network switches that use the bridging subsystem, we can view the MAC address table (forwarding database) using the bridge command. For example, to display the MAC addresses learned by a specific bridge (letâ€™s say the bridge interface is called br0), we would run:

bridge fdb show dev br0

* An example of such a table

33:33:00:00:00:01 dev br0 vlan 1 master br0 self permanent
00:11:22:33:44:55 dev eth1 vlan 1 master br0 self dynamic
