In the DHCP process, a client without an IP address first broadcasts a DHCP Discover message to locate available DHCP servers. Any server on the network then responds with a DHCP Offer, proposing an IP address lease and providing details such as the subnet mask, default gateway and DNS servers. The client next sends a DHCP Request, indicating it intends to accept the offered configuration. Finally, the server sends a DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK), officially assigning the IP address to the client. Capturing these messages in Wireshark (often filtered by “bootp”) shows how the client initially uses 0.0.0.0 as its source IP and broadcasts to 255.255.255.255, while the DHCP server uses port 67 and the client uses port 68. This four-step “DORA” exchange—Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge—ensures the client receives valid network configuration without manual intervention.
