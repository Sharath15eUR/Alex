To check if your default gateway is reachable, you can use the ping command along with the gateway's IP address. This command sends small data packets from your computer to the gateway and waits for a response. If you receive replies, it confirms that the gateway that serves as the connection point between your local network and the broader internet is functioning correctly and is accessible from your system. The default gateway acts as a bridge for your network traffic to reach other networks.
